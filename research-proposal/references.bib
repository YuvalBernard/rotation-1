  abstract = {Amide Proton Transfer (APT) reports on contrast derived from the exchange of protons between amide groups and water. Commonly, APT contrast is quantified by asymmetry analysis, providing an ensemble contrast of both amide proton concentration and exchange rate. An alternative is to sample the off-resonant spectrum and fit an exchange model, permitting the APT effect to be quantified, correcting automatically for confounding effects of spillover, field inhomogeneity, and magnetization transfer. Additionally, it should permit amide concentration and exchange rate to be independently quantified. Here, a Bayesian method is applied to this problem allowing pertinent prior information to be specified. A three-pool model was used incorporating water protons, amide protons, and magnetization transfer effect. The method is demonstrated in simulations, creatine phantoms with varying pH and in vivo (               n               = 7). The Bayesian model-based approach was able to quantify the APT effect accurately (root-mean-square error {$<$} 2\%) even when subject to confounding field variation and magnetization transfer effect, unlike traditional asymmetry analysis. The in vivo results gave approximate APT concentration (relative to water) and exchange rate values of 3 \texttimes{} 10               -3               and 15 s               -1               . A degree of correlation was observed between these parameter making the latter difficult to quantify with absolute accuracy, suggesting that more optimal sampling strategies might be required.

  abstract = {Lithium metal anodes offer a huge leap in the energy density of batteries, yet their implementation is limited by solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) formation and dendrite deposition. A key challenge in developing electrolytes leading to the SEI with beneficial properties is the lack of experimental approaches for directly probing the ionic permeability of the SEI. Here, we introduce lithium chemical exchange saturation transfer (Li-CEST) as an efficient nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) approach for detecting the otherwise invisible process of Li exchange across the metal-SEI interface. In Li-CEST, the properties of the undetectable SEI are encoded in the NMR signal of the metal resonance through their exchange process. We benefit from the high surface area of lithium dendrites and are able, for the first time, to detect exchange across solid phases through CEST. Analytical Bloch-McConnell models allow us to compare the SEI permeability formed in different electrolytes, making the presented Li-CEST approach a powerful tool for designing electrolytes for metal-based batteries.

Special focus is given to studies that employ signal enhancement (hyperpolarization) methods such as dissolution dynamic nuclear polarization (dDNP) and involving nuclear spin-bearing solutes that undergo reactions mediated by enzymes and membrane transport proteins. We extend the work given in a recent presentation on this topic (Kuchel and Shishmarev, 2020) to now include enzymes with two or more substrates and various enzyme reaction mechanisms as classified by Cleland, with particular reference to non-first-order processes. Using this approach, we can address some pressing questions in the field from a theoretical standpoint. For example, why does binding of a hyperpolarized substrate to an enzyme not cause an appreciable loss of the signal from the substrate or product? Why does the concentration of an unlabelled pool of substrate, for example 12C lactate, cause an increase in the rate of exchange of the 13C-labelled pool? To what extent is the equilibrium position of the reaction perturbed during administration of the substrate? The formalism gives a full mechanistic understanding of the time courses derived and is of relevance to ongoing clinical trials using these techniques.},

The enhanced spectral resolution of paraGEST, achieved by a strong pseudo contact shift induction, revealed that different molecular guests can adopt multiple orientations within Ln-{$\beta$}-CDs' cavities and, in contrast, only a single orientation inside Ln-{$\alpha$}-CDs. Thus, paraGEST, which can significantly improve NMR detectability and spectral resolution of host-guest systems that experience fast exchange dynamics, is a convenient tool for studying supramolecular systems of metal-capped molecular hosts.},

  abstract = {Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) is a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm that avoids the random walk behavior and sensitivity to correlated parameters that plague many MCMC methods by taking a series of steps informed by first-order gradient information. These features allow it to converge to high-dimensional target distributions much more quickly than simpler methods such as random walk Metropolis or Gibbs sampling. However, HMC's performance is highly sensitive to two user-specified parameters: a step size and a desired number of steps L. In particular, if L is too small then the algorithm exhibits undesirable random walk behavior, while if L is too large the algorithm wastes computation. We introduce the No-U-Turn Sampler (NUTS), an extension to HMC that eliminates the need to set a number of steps L. NUTS uses a recursive algorithm to build a set of likely candidate points that spans a wide swath of the target distribution, stopping automatically when it starts to double back and retrace its steps. Empirically, NUTS perform at least as efficiently as and sometimes more efficiently than a well tuned standard HMC method, without requiring user intervention or costly tuning runs. We also derive a method for adapting the step size parameter on the fly based on primal-dual averaging. NUTS can thus be used with no hand-tuning at all. NUTS is also suitable for applications such as BUGS-style automatic inference engines that require efficient ``turnkey'' sampling algorithms.},

The most common agents are Gd3+-based complexes that shorten bulk water T1 by rapid exchange of a single innersphere water molecule with bulk solvent water. Current gadolinium agents lack tissue specificity and typically do not respond to their chemical environment. Recently, it has been demonstrated that MR contrast may be altered by an entirely different mechanism based on chemical exchange saturation transfer (CEST). CEST contrast can originate from exchange of endogenous amide or hydroxyl protons or from exchangeable sites on exogenous CEST agents. This has opened the door for the discovery of new classes of responsive agents ranging from MR gene reporter molecules to small molecules that sense their tissue environment and respond to biological events.},

The focus of this review is on basic magnetic resonance principles underlying CEST and similarities to and differences with conventional magnetization transfer contrast. In CEST magnetic resonance imaging, transfer of magnetization is studied in mobile compounds instead of semisolids. Similar to magnetization transfer contrast, CEST has contributions of both chemical exchange and dipolar cross-relaxation, but the latter can often be neglected if exchange is fast. Contrary to magnetization transfer contrast, CEST imaging requires sufficiently slow exchange on the magnetic resonance time scale to allow selective irradiation of the protons of interest. As a consequence, magnetic labeling is not limited to radio-frequency saturation but can be expanded with slower frequency-selective approaches such as inversion, gradient dephasing and frequency labeling. The basic theory, design criteria, and experimental issues for exchange transfer imaging are discussed. A new classification for CEST agents based on exchange type is proposed. The potential of this young field is discussed, especially with respect to in vivo application and translation to humans. Magn Reson Med, 2011. \textcopyright{} 2011 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

To aid in the design of paramagnetic CEST agents for reporting important biological indices in MRI measurements, we formulated a theoretical framework based on the modified Bloch equations that relates the chemical properties of a CEST agent (e.g., water exchange rates and bound water chemical shifts) and various NMR parameters (e.g., relaxation rates and applied               B               1               field) to the measured CEST effect. Numerical solutions of this formulation for complex exchanging systems were readily obtained without algebraic manipulation or simplification. For paramagnetic CEST agents of the type used here, the CEST effect is relatively insensitive to the bound proton relaxation times, but requires a sufficiently large applied               B               1               field to highly saturate the Ln               3+               -bound water protons. This in turn requires paramagnetic complexes with large Ln               3+               -bound water chemical shifts to avoid direct excitation of the exchanging bulk water protons. Although increasing the exchange rate of the bound protons enhances the CEST effect, this also causes exchange broadening and increases the               B               1               required for saturation. For a given               B               1               , there is an optimal exchange rate that results in a maximal CEST effect. This numerical approach, which was formulated for a three-pool case, was incorporated into a MATLAB nonlinear least-square optimization routine, and the results were in excellent agreement with experimental               Z               -spectra obtained with an aqueous solution of a paramagnetic CEST agent containing two different types of bound protons (bound water and amide protons).

  abstract = {Chemical exchange saturation transfer (CEST) of metabolite protons that undergo exchange processes with the abundant water pool enables a specific contrast for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The CEST image contrast depends on physical and physiological parameters that characterize the microenvironment such as temperature, pH, and metabolite concentration. However, CEST imaging in vivo is a complex technique because of interferences with direct water saturation (spillover effect), the involvement of other exchanging pools, in particular macromolecular systems (magnetization transfer, MT), and nuclear Overhauser effects (NOEs). Moreover, there is a strong dependence of the diverse effects on the employed parameters of radiofrequency irradiation for selective saturation which makes interpretation of acquired signals difficult. This review considers analytical solutions of the Bloch\textendash McConnell (BM) equation system which enable deep insight and theoretical description of CEST and the equivalent off-resonant spinlock (SL) experiments. We derive and discuss proposed theoretical treatments in detail to understand the influence of saturation parameters on the acquired Z-spectrum and how the different effects interfere and can be isolated in MR Z-spectroscopy. Finally, we provide an overview of reported CEST effects in vivo and discuss proposed methods and technical approaches applicable to in vivo CEST studies on clinical MRI systems.},

The determination of the relative concentrations and exchange rates is commonly achieved by numerical integration of the Bloch\textendash McConnell equations. We derive an analytical solution of the Bloch\textendash McConnell equations that describes the magnetization of coupled spin populations under radiofrequency irradiation. As CEST and off-resonant SL are equivalent, their steady-state magnetization and dynamics can be predicted by the same single eigenvalue: the longitudinal relaxation rate in the rotating frame               R                                1                 {$\rho$}                              . For the case of slowly exchanging systems, e.g. amide protons, the saturation of the small proton pool is affected by transverse relaxation (R               2b               ). It turns out, that R               2b               is also significant for intermediate exchange, such as amine- or hydroxyl-exchange or paramagnetic CEST agents, if pools are only partially saturated.

With the appropriate projection factors, we obtain an analytical solution for CEST and SL for nonzero               R               2               of the exchanging pool, exchange rates in the range 1\textendash 10               4               Hz,               B               1               from 0.1 to 20 {$\mu$}T and arbitrary chemical shift differences between the exchanging pools, whilst considering the dilution by direct water saturation across the entire Z-spectra. This allows the optimization of irradiation parameters and the quantification of pH-dependent exchange rates and metabolite concentrations. In addition, we propose evaluation methods that correct for concomitant direct saturation effects. It is shown that existing theoretical treatments for CEST are special cases of this approach.
