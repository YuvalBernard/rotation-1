	abstract = {Background: Chemical exchange saturation transfer (CEST) magnetic resonance imaging can provide surrogate biomarkers for disease diagnosis. However, endogenous CEST effects are always diluted and contaminated by competing effects, which results in unwanted signal contributions that lessen the specificity of CEST to underlying biochemical exchange processes. The aim of this study was to examine a method for the accurate quantification of CEST effects.
Methods: A Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)-based Bayesian inference approach was proposed to estimate the exchange parameters, and CEST effects could be fitted using these estimations. This approach was tested in Bloch simulation and ischemic stroke rat experiments, and its performance was evaluated using quantification maps and numerical metrics.
Results: With 12 groups of simulations, the MCMC method achieved satisfactory fittings on both 2-pool and 5-pool models. The sum of squares error values and the root mean square error of the fitted Z-spectra were smaller than 10−3, and the coefficient of determination (R-squared) values were close to 1. The corresponding CEST quantification MTRRCeExST spectra were also well fitted and successfully separated the mixed CEST effects. The estimated parameters showed little bias relative to the ground truth, with errors between the true and estimated values of each parameter of less than 0.5\%. In the animal experiments, MTRRAemxide fitted using the MCMC method showed obvious contrast between ischemic and contralateral regions at the early stage. Compared with other quantification methods, it displayed the highest contrast-tonoise ratios (3.9, 2.73, and 3.93) and the lowest coefficient of variation values (0.181, 0.2224, and 0.2897) in all three stroke periods.
Conclusions: The MCMC method provided an efficient approach for parameter estimation and CEST effect quantification. The method may therefore be useful in achieving an accurate pathological diagnosis.},

	abstract = {The purpose of this study was to demonstrate a simple and fast method for solving the time-dependent Bloch equations. First, the timedependent Bloch equations were reduced to a homogeneous linear differential equation, and then a simple equation was derived to solve it using a matrix operation. The validity of this method was investigated by comparing with the analytical solutions in the case of constant radiofrequency irradiation. There was a good agreement between them, indicating the validity of this method. As a further example, this method was applied to the time-dependent Bloch equations in the two-pool exchange model for chemical exchange saturation transfer (CEST) or amide proton transfer (APT) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and the Z-spectra and asymmetry spectra were calculated from their solutions. They were also calculated using the fourth/fifth-order Runge-Kutta-Fehlberg (RKF) method for comparison. There was also a good agreement between them, and this method was much faster than the RKF method. In conclusion, this method will be useful for analyzing the complex CEST or APT contrast mechanism and/or investigating the optimal conditions for CEST or APT MRI.},

Special focus is given to studies that employ signal enhancement (hyperpolarization) methods such as dissolution dynamic nuclear polarization (dDNP) and involving nuclear spin-bearing solutes that undergo reactions mediated by enzymes and membrane transport proteins. We extend the work given in a recent presentation on this topic (Kuchel and Shishmarev, 2020) to now include enzymes with two or more substrates and various enzyme reaction mechanisms as classiﬁed by Cleland, with particular reference to non-ﬁrst-order processes. Using this approach, we can address some pressing questions in the ﬁeld from a theoretical standpoint. For example, why does binding of a hyperpolarized substrate to an enzyme not cause an appreciable loss of the signal from the substrate or product? Why does the concentration of an unlabelled pool of substrate, for example 12C lactate, cause an increase in the rate of exchange of the 13C-labelled pool? To what extent is the equilibrium position of the reaction perturbed during administration of the substrate? The formalism gives a full mechanistic understanding of the time courses derived and is of relevance to ongoing clinical trials using these techniques.},

	abstract = {Chemical exchange saturation transfer (CEST) of metabolite protons that undergo exchange processes with the abundant water pool enables a speciﬁc contrast for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The CEST image contrast depends on physical and physiological parameters that characterize the microenvironment such as temperature, pH, and metabolite concentration. However, CEST imaging in vivo is a complex technique because of interferences with direct water saturation (spillover effect), the involvement of other exchanging pools, in particular macromolecular systems (magnetization transfer, MT), and nuclear Overhauser effects (NOEs). Moreover, there is a strong dependence of the diverse effects on the employed parameters of radiofrequency irradiation for selective saturation which makes interpretation of acquired signals difﬁcult. This review considers analytical solutions of the Bloch–McConnell (BM) equation system which enable deep insight and theoretical description of CEST and the equivalent off-resonant spinlock (SL) experiments. We derive and discuss proposed theoretical treatments in detail to understand the inﬂuence of saturation parameters on the acquired Z-spectrum and how the different effects interfere and can be isolated in MR Z-spectroscopy. Finally, we provide an overview of reported CEST effects in vivo and discuss proposed methods and technical approaches applicable to in vivo CEST studies on clinical MRI systems.},

	abstract = {Bayesian statistics is an approach to data analysis based on Bayes’ theorem, where available knowledge about parameters in a statistical model is updated with the information in observed data. The background knowledge is expressed as a prior distribution and combined with observational data in the form of a likelihood function to determine the posterior distribution. The posterior can also be used for making predictions about future events. This Primer describes the stages involved in Bayesian analysis, from specifying the prior and data models to deriving inference, model checking and refinement. We discuss the importance of prior and posterior predictive checking, selecting a proper technique for sampling from a posterior distribution, variational inference and variable selection. Examples of successful applications of Bayesian analysis across various research fields are provided, including in social sciences, ecology, genetics, medicine and more. We propose strategies for reproducibility and reporting standards, outlining an updated WAMBS (when to Worry and how to Avoid the Misuse of Bayesian Statistics) checklist.

The most common agents are Gd3+-based complexes that shorten bulk water T1 by rapid exchange of a single innersphere water molecule with bulk solvent water. Current gadolinium agents lack tissue speciﬁcity and typically do not respond to their chemical environment. Recently, it has been demonstrated that MR contrast may be altered by an entirely different mechanism based on chemical exchange saturation transfer (CEST). CEST contrast can originate from exchange of endogenous amide or hydroxyl protons or from exchangeable sites on exogenous CEST agents. This has opened the door for the discovery of new classes of responsive agents ranging from MR gene reporter molecules to small molecules that sense their tissue environment and respond to biological events.},

	abstract = {Bayesian statistics is an approach to data analysis based on Bayes’ theorem, where available knowledge about parameters in a statistical model is updated with the information in observed data. The background knowledge is expressed as a prior distribution and combined with observational data in the form of a likelihood function to determine the posterior distribution. The posterior can also be used for making predictions about future events. This Primer describes the stages involved in Bayesian analysis, from specifying the prior and data models to deriving inference, model checking and refinement. We discuss the importance of prior and posterior predictive checking, selecting a proper technique for sampling from a posterior distribution, variational inference and variable selection. Examples of successful applications of Bayesian analysis across various research fields are provided, including in social sciences, ecology, genetics, medicine and more. We propose strategies for reproducibility and reporting standards, outlining an updated WAMBS (when to Worry and how to Avoid the Misuse of Bayesian Statistics) checklist. Finally, we outline the impact of Bayesian analysis on artificial intelligence, a major goal in the next decade.},

He participated in the Manhattan Project, originated the Teller–Ulam design of thermonuclear weapons, discovered the concept of the cellular automaton, invented the Monte Carlo method of computation, and suggested nuclear pulse propulsion. In pure and applied mathematics, he proved some theorems and proposed several conjectures. Born into a wealthy Polish Jewish family, Ulam studied mathematics at the Lwów Polytechnic Institute, where he earned his PhD in 1933 under the supervision of Kazimierz Kuratowski and Włodzimierz Stożek. In 1935, John von Neumann, whom Ulam had met in Warsaw, invited him to come to the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey, for a few months. From 1936 to 1939, he spent summers in Poland and academic years at Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts, where he worked to establish important results regarding ergodic theory. On 20 August 1939, he sailed for the United States for the last time with his 17-year-old brother Adam Ulam. He became an assistant professor at the University of Wisconsin–Madison in 1940, and a United States citizen in 1941.},

	abstract = {T he year was 1945. Two earth-shaking events took place: the successful test at Alamogordo and the building of the first electronic computer. Their combined impact was to modify qualitatively the nature of global interactions between Russia and the West. No less perturbative were the changes wrought in all of academic research and in applied science. On a less grand scale these events brought about a renascence of a mathematical technique known to the old guard as statistical sampling ; in its new surroundings and owing to its nature, there was no denying its new name of the Monte Carlo method. This essay attempts to describe the details that led to this renascence and the roles played by the various actors. It is appropriate that it appears in an issue dedicated to Stan Ulam. Most of us have grown so blase about computer developments and capabilities-even some that are spectacular—that it is difficult to believe or imagine there was a time when we suffered the noisy, painstakingly slow, electromechanical devices that chomped away on punched cards. Their saving grace was that they continued working around the clock, except for maintenance and occasional repair (such as removing a dust particle from a relay gap). But these machines helped enormously with the routine, relatively simple calculations that led to Hi-roshima. The ENIAC. During this wartime period , a team of scientists, engineers, and technicians was working furiously on the first electronic computer—the ENIAC— at the University of Pennsylvania in Phil-adelphia. Their mentors were Physicist First Class John Mauchly and Brilliant Engineer Presper Eckert. Mauchly, familiar with Geiger counters in physics laboratories, had realized that if electronic circuits could count, then they could do arithmetic and hence solve, inter alia, difference equations—at almost incredible speeds! When he'd seen a seemingly limitless array of women cranking out firing tables with desk calculators, he'd been inspired to propose to the Ballistics Research Laboratory at Aberdeen that an electronic computer be built to deal with these calculations.},

	abstract = {Stan is a probabilistic programming language for specifying statistical models. A Stan program imperatively defines a log probability function over parameters conditioned on specified data and constants. As of version 2.14.0, Stan provides full Bayesian inference for continuous-variable models through Markov chain Monte Carlo methods such as the No-U-Turn sampler, an adaptive form of Hamiltonian Monte Carlo sampling. Penalized maximum likelihood estimates are calculated using optimization methods such as the limited memory Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno algorithm. Stan is also a platform for computing log densities and their gradients and Hessians, which can be used in alternative algorithms such as variational Bayes, expectation propagation, and marginal inference using approximate integration. To this end, Stan is set up so that the densities, gradients, and Hessians, along with intermediate quantities of the algorithm such as acceptance probabilities, are easily accessible. Stan can be called from the command line using the cmdstan package, through R using the rstan package, and through Python using the pystan package. All three interfaces support sampling and optimization-based inference with diagnostics and posterior analysis. rstan and pystan also provide access to log probabilities, gradients, Hessians, parameter transforms, and specialized plotting.},
